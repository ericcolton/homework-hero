Overview: A Continent at War
The world of the first four Wings of Fire books is defined by a brutal, seemingly endless conflict that spans the entire dragon-shaped continent of Pyrrhia. For twenty years, a great war has raged, militarizing nearly every corner of the land and displacing countless dragons. The atmosphere is one of tension, suspicion, and violence, where tribal loyalties are paramount and crossing borders can mean death.

Amidst this chaos, hope is pinned on a mysterious, foreboding prediction known as The Dragonet Prophecy. It claims that five young dragons, hatched on the "brightest night," will rise to end the war and bring peace to Pyrrhia.

Major Components of the World
1. The Geography and the Tribes
Pyrrhia is divided into distinct biomes, each dominated by one of seven major dragon tribes, evolved with specific abilities suited to their environment.

SkyWings: Inhabitants of the high mountain peaks. They are powerful flyers and fierce fighters, currently ruled by the cruel and gladiatorial Queen Scarlet.

SeaWings: An aquatic tribe living in the ocean and underwater palaces. They have bioluminescent scales and can breathe underwater. Their kingdom is currently isolated and paranoid due to the war.

MudWings: Swamp-dwelling dragons known for their brute strength, connection to the earth, and intense bonds with their siblings.

SandWings: Desert dragons possessing venomous barbed tails like scorpions. They are the epicenter of the current conflict.

IceWings: Dragons of the frozen north, capable of exhaling deadly "frostbreath." They pride themselves on rigid hierarchy and aristocracy.

RainWings: Inhabitants of the rainforest. They can change their scale color for camouflage (or emotion) and shoot venom. In the first four books, the rest of Pyrrhia views them as lazy, passive, and irrelevant to world affairs.

NightWings: The most mysterious tribe, living on a secret volcanic island hidden by smoke. They are feared and respected because they are believed to possess the powers of mind-reading and seeing the future—powers they use to manipulate the other tribes from the shadows.

(Note: "Scavengers"—the dragon word for humans—exist in this world, but they are viewed merely as small, sometimes annoying prey animals with no political power.)

2. The War of SandWing Succession
The driving force of the plot is a three-way civil war over the SandWing throne. Following the death of the previous Queen Oasis (killed accidentally by a scavenger), her three daughters split the continent with their rivalry:

Burn: The oldest, strongest, and most brutal sister. She is allied with the SkyWings and MudWings.

Blister: The cunning, manipulative, and intelligent middle sister. She is allied with the SeaWings.

Blaze: The youngest, vainest, and least warlike sister. She is allied with the IceWings.

The Prophecy states that the five destined dragonets will choose which of these sisters becomes the new SandWing Queen, thereby ending the war.

3. The Talons of Peace
A secret underground organization composed of dragons from various tribes who oppose the war. They took it upon themselves to steal the five prophesied eggs and raise the dragonets in a hidden cave under a mountain to ensure the prophecy is fulfilled—often using harsh and controlling methods to keep the dragonets "safe" and ignorant of the outside world until they deemed them ready.

General Themes (Books 1-4)
Destiny vs. Free Will: The central theme of the first four books is the weight of expectation. The protagonists were raised believing their entire lives were pre-written by a prophecy. As they escape into the real world, they must grapple with whether they want to fulfill a destiny they didn't choose, or if they can forge their own path to peace.

Nature vs. Nurture: The dragonets constantly fight against the stereotypes of their species. For example, a "vicious" SeaWing princess learning prudence, or a "lazy" RainWing proving herself to be a capable leader.

The Brutality of War: Despite being a middle-grade series, these books do not shy away from the grim realities of war. The world outside the dragonets' cave is filled with gladiatorial arenas, assassinations, political betrayals, and the psychological toll of constant conflict on young minds.

Found Family: The five protagonists are separated from their biological families at birth. Their bond with each other—forged in captivity and strengthened through shared trauma—becomes the emotional core of the series, proving stronger than tribal loyalty or bloodlines.

Major Characters: The Dragonets of Destiny
The first four books focus on the perspectives of the five dragonets named in the prophecy, as they escape their guardians and confront the reality of the war-torn world.

Clay (MudWing): The emotional anchor of the group. He is large and physically powerful but gentle, protective, and deeply loyal to his friends. He constantly resists the violent stereotype of his tribe.

Tsunami (SeaWing): The fierce, impulsive, and courageous lost princess of the SeaWing kingdom. She is desperate to take charge and reunite with her royal family, only to find palace life more dangerous than she imagined.

Glory (RainWing): Sharp-tongued, sarcastic, and highly intelligent. She is the "mistake" of the group—a RainWing egg stolen only because the prophesied SkyWing egg was destroyed. She spends the first four books driven by a need to prove that she is not useless and that her tribe is not weak.

Starflight (NightWing): The anxious, bookish scholar of the group. He relies heavily on scrolls for knowledge and is initially terrified of the real world. He struggles immensely with the pressure of being a NightWing, as everyone expects him to have magical powers he does not possess.

Sunny (SandWing): The smallest and most optimistic of the dragonets. She looks unusual for a SandWing (too golden, missing the venomous tail barb). She is the moral compass of the group, always believing in the best in others and desiring a peaceful resolution over violence.
